# Structure_From_Motion

# Overview

Structure from motion is a photogrammetric range imaging technique for estimating three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional image sequences that may be coupled with local motion signals.

Main objective : To implement the research paper Shape and motion from image streams under orthography: a factorization method

Different tracking and feature detection were used :
1. KLT tracker with goodfeaturestotrack
2. KLT tracker with SIFT/ORB .
